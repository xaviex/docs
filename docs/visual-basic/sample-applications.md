# Visual Basic Sample Applications
You can use Visual Studio to download and install samples of full, packaged Visual Basic applications from the [MSDN Code Gallery](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/)  
  
 You can download each sample individually, or you can download a Sample Pack, which contains related samples that share a technology or topic. Youâ€™ll receive a notification when source code changes are published for any sample that you download.
